## Basics to use

### USAGE

#### `ft [OPTIONS] [text] [path]`
This basics form is **find** a string in a file and a string in among the files in the directory.

### ARGS

#### `[text]`
The `[text]` argument is the text you want to find. If your `[text]` argument contains spaces, be sure to include the `'` or `"`  quotes.

#### `[path]`
The `[path]` argument is the file or directory you want to find. If the `[path]` argument contains spaces, be sure to include the `'` or `"` quotes.

If you enter `.` or leave it empty for the `[path]` argument, it will search for the string in files in the current directory.

If you want to leave the `[text]` argument blank and enter only the `[path]` argument, you must enter a space character, such as '', in the `[text]` argument.

If you omit the `[text]` argument and enter only the `[path]` argument, `ft` considers it to be a positional argument, and treats the argument you entered as the [path] argument as the [text] argument.
